# TypeScript Types

This directory contains TypeScript type definitions used throughout the application.

## Guidelines

- Group related types into domain-specific files
- Export types from a central `index.ts` file when appropriate
- Use descriptive names that clearly communicate the purpose of the type
- Prefer interfaces for object shapes that can be extended
- Prefer type aliases for unions, intersections, and simple types
- Use comments to document complex types
