# UI Components

This directory contains base UI components that are used as building blocks throughout the application.

These are primarily primitive components from the shadcn/ui library and custom UI primitives that are used to build more complex components.

## Guidelines

- Components here should be pure UI components with minimal to no business logic
- They should be highly reusable and customizable
- Props should allow for easy customization of appearance and behavior
- Avoid directly importing application-specific logic or constants
- Use TypeScript for strong typing and better developer experience
