# Common Components

This directory contains shared components that are used across multiple pages or features in the application.

## Subdirectories

- **layout/**: Contains structural UI components like headers, footers, navigation, etc.
- **feedback/**: Contains user feedback components like alerts, toasts, notifications, etc.

These components are designed to be reusable across the entire application and maintain consistent UI/UX patterns.
