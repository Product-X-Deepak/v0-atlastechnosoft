# Feature Components

This directory contains components that are specific to individual features or business domains in the application.

## Subdirectories

- **auth/**: Authentication-related components
- **services/**: Components related to service offerings
- **careers/**: Components related to careers and job listings

Each feature subdirectory should contain components that are specific to that feature and not intended for use across the entire application. Components that are used across multiple features should be moved to the `common` directory.
