# React Hooks

This directory contains custom React hooks used throughout the application.

## Guidelines
 
- Hooks should follow the React hooks naming convention (`use*`)
- Each hook should have a single responsibility
- Hooks should be well-documented with JSDoc comments
- Include TypeScript types for parameters and return values
- Avoid UI components in this directory
