The solution provides multiple discount methods including five different discount groups at the business partner level, total discounts on all items, and special prices for selected items. At the item level, you can configure period and volume discounts and create multiple price lists factored against a base price. The 2025 version enhances these capabilities with 'valid periods' for time-sensitive promotions with defined start and end dates, 'effective price' options to automatically calculate the lowest or highest price from available sources, and 'base pricing units' that allow you to set prices based on any package size instead of just the smallest unit. These features give you precise control over pricing strategies while eliminating calculation errors.",
